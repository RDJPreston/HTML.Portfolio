<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello everyone, I've only recently started to learn to code. I'm really enjoying it and I love the challanges I've come across so far.</p>

<p>This is just a small show case of everything I've learnt so far, and to see if I rememeber the lessons that have been taught, I'm hoping for good results as I've been trying really hard.</p>

<p>Thank you for coming to this page to see what I'm about, I apprecite the feedback and any thoughts you may have.</p>
